## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the flight time of a drone using machine learning models. The model is trained on synthetic data generated based on key design parameters such as battery capacity, motor power consumption, and propeller efficiency.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### 1. Train the Model
Run the `train.py` script to train the model and save it:
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

### 2. Make Predictions
Run the `predict.py` script to load the trained model and make predictions:
```bash
python scripts/predict.py
```
